# PyCPIDR
Python library port of the Computerized Propositional Idea Density Rate (CPIDR) 3.2.

PyCPIDR is a Python library that determines the propositional idea density of an English text automatically.

CPIDR 3.2 is a computer program with source code released under the GPL v2 in 2007. It was written by Michael Covington and was a product of the CASPR project (Computer Analysis of Speech for Psychological Research) at The University of Georgia.

I have ported that code to Python for use as a library. I have also added unit tests based on passages provided by Turner and Green (1977) and Turner (1987).

# Authorship and version history 
The name CPIDR has been applied to several programs: 
- A prototype idea density rater implemented in Prolog by Cati Brown; 
- A Java program implemented by Tony Snodgrass, using a somewhat more 
sophisticated rule set (Brown et al. 2007); 
- The same program, ported to C# by the same author and using the same 
rule set (CPIDR 2); 
- The C# program coded by Michael A. Covington, using a 
considerably refined rule set (CPIDR 3), described further by Brown et al. 
(in preparation). 
- This Python library port by Jason Robison of Covington's C# code.


## License
As the original code was GPL v2, this port is as well.
